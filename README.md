Eyra is a package that supports building Rust programs implemented entirely
in Rust.

It uses [Origin] for program and thread startup and shutdown, and [c-gull] for
ABI-compatible libc functions.

[Origin]: https://github.com/sunfishcode/origin#readme
[c-gull]: https://github.com/sunfishcode/c-ward/tree/main/c-gull#readme

## Quick start

Check out [this hello world example].

[this hello world example]: https://github.com/sunfishcode/eyra/tree/main/example-crates/hello-world/

## In detail

Eyra needs three things. First, a Cargo.toml dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
eyra = "<current-version>"
```

The next step is to add an `extern crate`:

```rust
extern crate eyra;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

This tells Rust that Eyra is actually used and the libraries should actually
be linked in.

And finally, a build.rs file to add `-nostartfiles` to the link flags to
disable the host startup code, so that Eyra can provide its own. build.rs:

```rust,no_run
fn main() {
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg=-nostartfiles");
}
```

With these three steps, this crate prints "Hello, world!". And under the
covers, it uses [Origin] to start and stop the program, [c-ward] to handle
libc calls from `std`, and [rustix] to do the printing, so it's completely
implemented in Rust.

## Optional logging

Eyra has a `log` feature to enable Rust `log` tracing of program and thread
startup and shutdown, and an `env_logger` feature to install `env_logger`
as the logger, which can be enabled in Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
eyra = { version = "<current-version>", features = ["log", "env_logger"] }
```

With this, and setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to "trace", the
hello world program output like this:

```console
[TRACE origin::program] Program started
[TRACE origin::thread] Main Thread[51383] initialized
[TRACE origin::program] Calling `.init_array`-registered function `0x55e86306bb80(1, 0x7ffd0f76aad8, 0x7ffd0f76aae8)`
[TRACE origin::program] Calling `origin_main(1, 0x7ffd0f76aad8, 0x7ffd0f76aae8)`
Hello, world!
[TRACE origin::program] `origin_main` returned `0`
[TRACE origin::thread] Thread[51383] calling `at_thread_exit`-registered function
[TRACE origin::thread] Thread[51383] calling `at_thread_exit`-registered function
[TRACE origin::program] Program exiting
```

## Background

Eyra is similar to [Mustang] and uses the same underlying code, but instead
of using a custom target and -Z build-std, Eyra just needs users to add
`-nostartfiles` to their link line, such as via build.rs in the example.

Like Mustang, Eyra currently runs on Rust Nightly on Linux on x86-64, x86,
aarch64, and riscv64. It aims to support all Linux versions
[supported by Rust], though at this time it's only tested on relatively recent
versions. It's complete enough to run:
 - [ripgrep](https://github.com/sunfishcode/ripgrep/tree/eyra)
 - [coreutils](https://github.com/sunfishcode/coreutils/tree/eyra),
   including the "unix" feature set
 - [async-std](https://github.com/sunfishcode/tide/tree/eyra)
 - [tokio](https://github.com/sunfishcode/tokio/tree/eyra)
 - [bat](https://github.com/sunfishcode/bat/tree/eyra), including git
   support with libgit2
 - [cargo-watch](https://github.com/sunfishcode/cargo-watch/tree/eyra)
