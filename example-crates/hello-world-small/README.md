This crate demonstrates the use of Eyra with a smaller binary size!

This is the same as the [hello-world] example, but enables some options
described in [min-sized-rust] to reduce the size of the final binary.

It uses the [workaround to support -Zbuild-std], and can be built with
a command like this:

```console
$ RUSTFLAGS="-Z location-detail=none -C relocation-model=static -Ctarget-feature=+crt-static" cargo +nightly run -Z build-std=std,panic_abort -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```

This applies all the techniques described on the [min-sized-rust] page
before [Remove `core::fmt` with `no_main` and Careful Usage of `libstd`].

As of this writing, this compiles to 24,616 bytes. For comparison, using all
these same optimizations without Eyra, and using `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
(which produces smaller statically-linked binaries than
`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`), compiles to 30,288 bytes.

If you're interested in going further down the `#![no_main]`/`#![no_std]`
path, consider [using Origin directly] which can get down to 408 bytes. Or,
consider using [Origin Studio] if you want to go there but still have
`println!`.
